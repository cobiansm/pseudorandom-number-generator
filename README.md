# CHACHA20 in FRDM-K64 

## Overview

This project implements the **ChaCha20** stream cipher on the **FRDM-K64** development board using C and the MCUXpresso SDK. It demonstrates the generation of a 64-byte keystream and the encryption/decryption process through XOR operations, validating the algorithm’s functionality on an embedded ARM Cortex-M4 platform.
